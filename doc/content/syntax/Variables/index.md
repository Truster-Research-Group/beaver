# Variables System

## Description

The `Variables` block within an input file is utilized to define the unknowns within a system
of partial differential equations. These unknowns are often referred to as nonlinear variables
within documentation. The nonlinear variables defined within this block are used by
[Kernel objects](syntax/Kernels/index.md) to define the equations for a simulation.

TODO: mention FV variables and how they are similar+different

## Example

The following input file snippet demonstrates the creation of a single nonlinear variable that
is used by two Kernel objects, refer to [Example 2](ex02_kernel.md optional=True) for more details.
