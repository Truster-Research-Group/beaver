Beaver is based on [MOOSE](http://mooseframework.org). MOOSE is an extremely flexible environment that
permits the solution of coupled physics problems of varying size and dimensionality. These can be
solved using computer hardware appropriate for the model size, ranging from laptops and workstations
to large high performance computers.

Beaver is developed at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville by the Computational Laboratory for the Mechanics of Interfaces.
