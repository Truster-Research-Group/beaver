# Traction Interface Action

## Description

The Traction Interface `Master` action simplifies the input file syntax for generating the VMNS traction interface kernel, its associated displacement jump 
by referencing the Cohesive Zone material object, and its traction average and jump material. See the description, example use, and parameters on the [VMNS/TracInter](syntax/Beaver/VMNS/TracInter/index.md) action system page.
